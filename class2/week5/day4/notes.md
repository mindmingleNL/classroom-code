# Testing

Make sure your application works, making sure there are no breaking bugs or errors according to some specification

## Ways to test

- Try breaking it
- Try running your code and see what it does
- User testing, collect the bugs they find
- Penetration testing, test if a hacker can come in
- **Automated testing (machine testing)**

## Why do we test?

- To prevent stuff from breaking
  - To not lose money
- **To be confident when changing code**
  - Refactoring: The art of improving code
  - Premature Optimization <- BAD
    - "If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."
  - Code improves when:
    - DRY instead of WET
    - Easy to read
    - Easy to change
    - Faster?
    - Robustness?

## Types of automated testing

- Unit testing
  - Mocking? To create fake systems
- UI testing/End-to-end testing (e2e)
  - Workshop Cypress
- Integration testing
